1. I implemented a simple Bayesian model for sense disambiguation.

2. What I realized?

	1). Created vectors for all of the 4000 contxts based on only using TF. This part is implemented in init_bayesian_doc_vectors function.

	2). Created V_sum1 and V_sum2 for tank, plant, perplace, which is the same as part I. Instead of dividing by the number of vectors, I just let each sum be the summation of weight of term. This part is implemented in bayesian_normalization funtion.

	3). Did LogLikelihood ratio in bayesian_centroid function.

	4). In the bayesian_similarity function, the result is shown as comparation. However the result for either tank, plant, perplace is 0. The reason for causing this bug I think is the wrong input when I calculate $sumofLL. ( $sumofLL += $LLike{$term} * $Vtest{$term} ).
